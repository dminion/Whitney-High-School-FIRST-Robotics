FRC Line Tracker Sample Program
--------------------------------

This is a simple line tracker sample program that provides
a useful starting point for creating a robot program that
can autonomously put tubes on the wall for the 2011 FRC
game. The comments describe how it might be modified for
your own use and depends on the weight and speed of your own
robot. This has been tested at FIRST using the 2011 kitbot
with a charged battery.
